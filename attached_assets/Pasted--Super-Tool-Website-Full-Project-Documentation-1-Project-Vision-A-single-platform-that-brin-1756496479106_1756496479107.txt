🌐 Super-Tool Website — Full Project Documentation
1. 🎯 Project Vision

A single platform that brings together all everyday tools in one place: calculators, converters, image utilities, document utilities, audio/video tools.

Replace multiple single-tool websites (e.g., “PDF merger”, “image compressor”) with one super hub.

Designed for speed, simplicity, and accessibility.

Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile (PWA-ready).

Privacy-first (process locally where possible, auto-delete files).

Backend

Next.js API routes (or Express/NestJS if scaling separately)

File handling: Sharp (images), FFmpeg (audio/video), PDF-lib (documents)

OCR: Tesseract.js (client) + Tesseract server fallback

Speech: Cloud APIs (Google/Azure) or local fallback

Database

PostgreSQL (for users, history, billing)

Prisma ORM

Redis (caching, rate limits, job queue)

Storage

Cloud (Amazon S3 / Cloudflare R2 / MinIO) for temporary files

Auto-deletion policy

Deployment

Vercel (frontend & APIs)

Render/Fly.io/DigitalOcean (workers for heavy tasks)

CDN for static assets

6. 🔐 Security & Privacy

File validation (type, size limits)

Auto-delete processed files

HTTPS everywhere

Rate limiting per user/IP

Virus scan (optional for PDF/Docs)

CSP & XSS protections

7. ⚡ Performance

12. 📱 User Flow Example

User opens Home Page → sees categories grid.

Clicks Converters → sees all converters in grid.

Clicks Currency Converter tool card → tool opens in 80% popup modal.

User selects input/output currencies, enters amount → sees result instantly.

Dropdown in modal → user switches to Unit Converter (same category) without leaving modal.

User saves result in profile (if logged in).
